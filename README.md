# Isometric-Minesweeper
A twist on a classic game, made in Pygame.
The code architecture is a bit of a mess. Any criticism or feedback is encouraged.

## Launching
You can run the game directly from start.py or from the .exe in the standalone folder.

## Requirements
This project was made in python using pygame library, you must have python 3.7 and pygame 1.9.3 or higher installed to compile this game.

## Some special features
This game allows you to turn on debug mode, shown in one of the screenshots, which highlights tiles that are bombs as red, and tiles that are mine-free-zones as cyan.

Users can also adjust the difficulty by changing the number of bombs in the options menu.

## Known Bugs
Sometimes Middle Mouse Button (Chording) does not function as intended, and the highlighted area does not follow the mouse.
