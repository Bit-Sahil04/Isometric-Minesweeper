# Isometric-Minesweeper
A twist on the classic windows game, made in Pygame.

## Launching
You can run the game directly from run.py or from the .exe in /standalone folder.

## Requirements
This project was made in python using pygame library, you must have python 2.7 and pygame 1.9.3 or higher installed to play this game.

## Developer's Comments
This is my first 'serious' project so the code architecture is a bit of a mess. Any criticism or feedback is encouraged.

## Some special features
This game allows you to turn on debug mode, shown in one of the screenshots, which highlights tiles that are bombs as red, and tiles that are mine-free-zones as cyan.

Users can also adjust the difficulty by changing the number of bombs in the options menu.

## Known Bugs
Sometimes Middle Mouse Button does not function as intended, and the highlighted area does not follow the mouse.
